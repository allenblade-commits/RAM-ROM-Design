Description:
This module implements a simple **Single Port RAM** (Random Access Memory) 
with synchronous write and asynchronous read behavior.

Features:
- 8-bit data width
- 64 memory locations (address range: 0â€“63)
- Data is written to memory on the rising edge of the clock when `we` (write enable) is high.
- When `we` is low, the address is latched, and the corresponding data is made available on output `q`.

Ports:
  - data [7:0] : 8-bit input data to be written into memory.
  - addr [5:0] : 6-bit address input (selects one of 64 memory locations).
  - we         : Write enable signal; when high, performs write operation.
  - clk        : Clock input; memory operations occur on the rising edge.
  - q [7:0]    : 8-bit output data from the addressed memory location.
